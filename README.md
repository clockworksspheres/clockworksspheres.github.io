Organization website for clockworksspheres related projects and contributions

If you know anyone that likes playing with python, or wants to learn it - I'm hoping to find some help making some help with a couple of projects on Github clockworksspheres projects, has some basic stuff, stretching skills stuff, and potentially some advanced stuff too.
 
## [abrWords](https://github.com/clockworksspheres/abrWords) Project
 
'abr' stands for Aphasia Brain Repair - or that's the goal, to help fix aphasia related issues generated by multiple health problems, that in the end caused multiple concussions over time, as well as what I believe to have been a mini-stroke.

We are hoping that better understanding the issues will help us focus on therapies that can get a brain - hopefully mine too - back into serviceable, working order, avoiding any "brain crash”, blackout or seizure.

One goal of the project is to help build, rebuild and/or repair the thought-language, language-speech, and language-writing bridges in the brain.


## [eisenban](https://github.com/clockworksspheres/eisenban) Project

Productivity software - combining the Eisenhower Matrix and Kanban methodologies

Simple app for managing time - right now simple is relative, throwing tons of stuff around, including framework ideas from different projects I’ve worked on in the past.    

 
## [advanced-learning-and-reseasrch-accelerator](https://github.com/clockworksspheres/advanced-learning-and-reseasrch-accelerator) Project

Advanced Learning and Research Accelerator - a computer/machine tool/entity that provides a symbiotic connection with the internet - intended for accelerating the both learning and research to distill, focus and make sense of, provide feedback loops to learning and research.  Intended users of the tools - students of all ages, any augmented reality hardware/software applications, as a training tool, basically anyone that needs to come to a quickly consume information, possibly making a fast decision based on data that may be anywhere.  Think [XR](https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/xr-ar-vr-mr-difference).

It seems people think AI is on the brink of becoming smarter and better than we are.  How about we think of it as just another tool - to help Humans learn, evolve and develop bettor solutions - for everything.

While AI is useful, how about we create plugins to tools like this - AI plugins to tools like this - that could compare results from various competing AI companies - Help us validate AI solutions, possibly against AI solutions - and/or share with SME’s (Subject Matter Experts), to add the human validation factor… 

Symbiotic relationship between man and machine is needed, and this project is aimed at just that.


 
## [ramdisk](https://github.com/clockworksspheres/ramdisk) Project

The ramdisk project is kinda old, haven't tested it in a while, should be working in Python (dev branch might work better than main) The two main things I still use it for is when building software - like the Qt or Pside/PyQt stack, or other scientific stacks, hook the ramdisk in as the temporary build cache, because WAAAY too often I've had build cache corruptions - and going down that rathole trying to figure out why things are building, and changes being made aren't changing things, because of corrupt build caches can take days to figure out sometimes, with bigger projects.  Another use is temporary disk usage in devops/secdevops processes.  Temporary devops/devsecops pipeline processes using ramdisks for product/process/system deployment can both speed things up, and help reduce problems related to cache poisoning.  One can keep the cache as long as it's useful, if errors start arising - one can slap an additional one up (assuming memory is available)to do testing/diagnosis of errors in parallel.

## [oci-containers](https://github.com/clockworksspheres/oci-containers) Project

The oci-containers project has some "how to" documents for installing all that's necessary for generic container development, for each of Windows, Linux and macOS.  Haven't updated them in a bit, but I'm installing/reinstalling all of those OS's, and may update the documents sometime before Christmas too.

It’s a collection of other very useful container repos, as well as customized tool containers.

OCI referred to in this repo is as defined by the CNCF, not Oracle's current definition.

Also houses IaC container templates for the IoTHarborAnywhere project.
